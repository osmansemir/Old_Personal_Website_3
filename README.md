# ðŸš€ Old Personal Website 3

This is third personal website, created when I was a studentâ€”before I had any knowledge of JavaScript. It represents my early steps into web development and serves as a reminder of how much I've grown since then.

## ðŸ”¥ Why This Project Matters  
- A glimpse into my early coding journey  
- Pure HTML & CSS, with no JavaScript  
- A reflection of how much I've improved as a developer  

## ðŸŽ¯ Lessons Learned  
- Fundamental HTML & CSS structure  
- The importance of clean, semantic code  
- How design and layout evolve with experience  

## ðŸš€ What's Next?  
While this project holds sentimental value, Iâ€™m now focused on building modern, interactive web applications using JavaScript, React, and other powerful tools.
